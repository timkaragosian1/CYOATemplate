### Introduction
Started on a journey to re-learn Android development in 2023. I began by learning Kotlin based off my previous knowledge of Android Java. From there, I decided to start building some things to learn. This project was my first "real" challenege in the sense that I took an existing, simple, and interesting project and modernized it. I was inspired by the work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NRVn2JJ1JM&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WVWGhGVlT25UGYFUt7k9DGX in both Java and Kotlin. I took this project and remade it using Jetpack Compose and wanted to then expand upon the concepts and thinking to a full game in a future project.

### Development
Using Google Android Training, Documentation, and other help articles, I was able to figure out how to implement Jetpack Compose with a very basic MVVM design pattern using very vanilla Kotlin. This expanded upon a previous Roshambo game I developed many years ago on the concepts of a "turn" and improving the MVP pattern popular in the past. There is a basic gameplay flow in this and not many actual objects.

This has been a very motivating project in a number of ways. It has me more comfortable with modern development concepts and reading code. I am better at finding documentation and more conifdent in the Google Android Training modules and searches. My mind is also thinking of better ways to use the MVVM pattern in an expanded application. 

### Future Thoughts
Upon completion, it was easy to see how this can become more. It will need a trickier way of handling the ViewModel, but with more objects such as enemies, encounters, scenes, and other data to help with logic and calculations in certain moments. This also has very little immersion for the player and lacking presentation media such as better artwork and audio. This is a good start to future projects!
